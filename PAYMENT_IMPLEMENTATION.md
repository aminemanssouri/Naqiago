# 💳 Payment System Implementation - COMPLETED

## ✅ What Was Done

The payment table was not being populated after booking creation. This has been **FIXED** with the following implementation:

---

## 📋 Changes Made

### 1. **Created Payment Service** (`src/services/payments.ts`)

A comprehensive payment service that handles:
- ✅ **Creating payment records** when a booking is made
- ✅ **Automatic calculation** of platform fees and worker earnings
- ✅ **Payment status updates** (pending → completed)
- ✅ **Gateway integration support** (transaction IDs, references)
- ✅ **Worker earnings tracking**
- ✅ **Customer payment history**

### 2. **Updated Booking Flow** (`src/screens/BookingPaymentScreen.tsx`)

Modified the booking creation process to:
- ✅ Create the booking first
- ✅ Immediately create a payment record
- ✅ Handle payment creation errors gracefully (booking still succeeds)
- ✅ Log detailed payment information for debugging

### 3. **Export Payment Service** (`src/services/index.ts`)

Added payment service to the main exports for easy importing.

---

## 💾 Database Schema (Reviewed from `database.md`)

```sql
CREATE TABLE public.payments (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  booking_id uuid → bookings(id),
  customer_id uuid → profiles(id),
  worker_id uuid → worker_profiles(id),
  amount numeric NOT NULL,
  currency varchar DEFAULT 'MAD',
  payment_method enum('cash', 'card', 'mobile', 'wallet') NOT NULL,
  status enum('pending', 'processing', 'completed', 'failed', 'refunded') DEFAULT 'pending',
  gateway_transaction_id varchar,
  gateway_reference varchar,
  gateway_response jsonb,
  platform_fee numeric DEFAULT 0.00,
  worker_earnings numeric NOT NULL,
  processed_at timestamp,
  created_at timestamp DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at timestamp DEFAULT now()
);
```

---

## 🔄 Payment Flow

### **When Booking is Created:**

```
1. User completes booking flow
2. BookingPaymentScreen.handleContinue() is called
3. Booking is created in database
4. Payment record is AUTOMATICALLY created with:
   - booking_id: Link to the booking
   - customer_id: User who made the booking
   - worker_id: Worker assigned to the booking
   - amount: Total price from booking
   - payment_method: Selected payment method (cash, card, etc.)
   - status: 'pending' (initial status)
   - platform_fee: 15% of total (configurable)
   - worker_earnings: 85% of total (amount - platform_fee)
5. Navigation to confirmation screen
```

### **Payment Status Lifecycle:**

```
pending → processing → completed
                    ↓
                  failed
                    ↓
                 refunded
```

---

## 💰 Platform Fee Calculation

**Default: 15% platform fee**

Example with 100 MAD booking:
```
Total Amount:     100 MAD
Platform Fee:      15 MAD (15%)
Worker Earnings:   85 MAD (85%)
```

You can customize the platform fee percentage:
```typescript
await paymentsService.createPayment({
  // ... other fields
  platformFeePercentage: 20 // Custom 20% fee
});
```

---

## 📊 Payment Service Methods

### **1. Create Payment**
```typescript
await paymentsService.createPayment({
  bookingId: 'booking-uuid',
  customerId: 'customer-uuid',
  workerId: 'worker-uuid',
  amount: 150.00,
  paymentMethod: 'cash',
  platformFeePercentage: 15 // Optional, defaults to 15%
});
```

### **2. Update Payment Status**
```typescript
await paymentsService.updatePaymentStatus(
  paymentId,
  'completed',
  {
    transactionId: 'TXN123456',
    reference: 'REF-2025-001',
    response: { /* gateway response */ }
  }
);
```

### **3. Get Payment by Booking**
```typescript
const payment = await paymentsService.getPaymentByBookingId(bookingId);
```

### **4. Process Cash Payment**
```typescript
// Marks cash payment as completed when service is done
await paymentsService.processCashPayment(bookingId);
```

### **5. Get Customer Payments**
```typescript
const payments = await paymentsService.getCustomerPayments(customerId);
```

### **6. Get Worker Earnings Summary**
```typescript
const summary = await paymentsService.getWorkerEarningsSummary(workerId);
// Returns: { totalEarnings, pendingEarnings, completedEarnings, totalPayments }
```

---

## 🧪 Testing

### **Test Script Created:** `testPaymentCreation.js`

Run the test to verify payment creation:
```bash
node testPaymentCreation.js
```

The test will:
1. ✅ Fetch a test booking from your database
2. ✅ Check if payment exists
3. ✅ Create a payment record if missing
4. ✅ Verify payment in database
5. ✅ Test payment status update

---

## 🔍 How to Verify Payment Creation

### **Option 1: Check Database Directly**
```sql
-- View all payments
SELECT 
  p.id,
  p.booking_id,
  b.booking_number,
  p.amount,
  p.payment_method,
  p.status,
  p.platform_fee,
  p.worker_earnings,
  p.created_at
FROM payments p
JOIN bookings b ON p.booking_id = b.id
ORDER BY p.created_at DESC;
```

### **Option 2: Check Console Logs**

When creating a booking, you'll see:
```
✅ Booking created successfully: { id, booking_number, ... }
✅ Payment record created successfully: { 
  id, 
  booking_id, 
  amount, 
  platform_fee, 
  worker_earnings 
}
```

### **Option 3: Use the Test Script**
```bash
node testPaymentCreation.js
```

---

## 🚨 Error Handling

The payment creation is wrapped in a try-catch block to ensure:
- ✅ **Booking creation succeeds** even if payment fails
- ✅ **Errors are logged** for debugging
- ✅ **User experience is not interrupted**

If payment creation fails:
```javascript
⚠️ Warning: Payment record creation failed: [error details]
Booking was created but payment record is missing
```

---

## 🎯 When Payment Status Changes

### **Cash Payments:**
```typescript
// When service is completed, mark payment as completed
await paymentsService.processCashPayment(bookingId);
```

### **Card/Digital Payments:**
```typescript
// After successful gateway processing
await paymentsService.updatePaymentStatus(
  paymentId,
  'completed',
  {
    transactionId: gatewayResponse.txnId,
    reference: gatewayResponse.reference,
    response: gatewayResponse
  }
);
```

---

## 📱 Integration Points

### **1. Booking Confirmation Screen**
Can display payment details:
```typescript
const payment = await paymentsService.getPaymentByBookingId(bookingId);
// Show: amount, payment method, status
```

### **2. Bookings History Screen**
Show payment status for each booking:
```typescript
const payments = await paymentsService.getCustomerPayments(userId);
```

### **3. Worker Dashboard**
Show earnings:
```typescript
const earnings = await paymentsService.getWorkerEarningsSummary(workerId);
// Display: total earnings, pending, completed
```
