- âœ… Price calculations based on vehicle type

### 4. **Database Services Available**
Your database now contains these services:
1. **Basic Wash** - 60 MAD (Exterior wash and dry)
2. **Deluxe Wash** - 120 MAD (Exterior + interior cleaning) 
3. **Premium Detail** - 220 MAD (Full detailing inside and out)
4. **Interior Detail** - 140 MAD (Deep vacuum and interior detailing)
5. **Wax & Shine** - 180 MAD (Professional wax and shine treatment)

## ðŸš€ How to Test:

### In Your React Native App:
1. Navigate to the **Services Selection** screen
2. You should now see **REAL services** from your database
3. Prices will automatically adjust based on vehicle type
4. Loading spinner will show while fetching data

### Test Different Scenarios:
- **With Internet**: See real Supabase data
- **Without Internet**: Cached data (if previously loaded)
- **Database Error**: Retry button appears

## ðŸ“± Next Steps:

### Ready to Implement:
- **Workers data** (similar pattern)
- **Bookings management** (create, update, real-time updates)
- **Real-time notifications**
- **Location-based worker search**

### Code Usage Example:
```typescript
// In your components, you can now use:
import { servicesService } from '../services';

// Get all services
const services = await servicesService.getServices();

// Get services with SUV pricing
const suvServices = await servicesService.getServicesWithVehiclePricing('suv');

// Check service availability
const availability = await servicesService.checkServiceAvailability(
  serviceId, '2025-09-29', '14:00'
);
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Status:
- âœ… **Services**: DONE (Real Supabase data)
- ðŸ”„ **Workers**: Ready to implement next
- ðŸ”„ **Bookings**: Ready to implement next

Your app is now successfully connected to Supabase and displaying real database content! ðŸš€
